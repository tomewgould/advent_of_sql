This repository contains my solutions to the Christmas-themed SQL challenges provided by [Advent of SQL.](https://adventofsql.com/)

I have completed these challenges using PostgreSQL to sharpen my skills and for a bit of fun! 

Solutions contain comments which explain my thinking as well as record what I learned completing each challenge.

## Summary of techniques applied/learned for each challenge

1. Extract JSON values using `JSON_VALUE`, `CASE` statements, CTEs

2. Decipher ASCII values using `CHR` and `STRING_AGG`

5. Window functions and percentage changes using `LAG`

6. Subquery using aggregate functions as a means to filter data

8. Recursive CTEs

9. Multiple CTEs with aggregate functions

10. Pivoting data using the `FILTER` function

11. Window functions to find a rolling average

12. Finding percentiles using `PERCENT_RANK`

13. Parse arrays into rows using `UNNEST`, `SPLIT_PART`

14. Parse JSON arrays into rows using `JSON_ARRAY_ELEMENTS`

15. Finding the intersection of points and polygons using PostGIS data types and `ST_INTERSECTS`

16. Joining tables on geographical conditions and calculating the time spent in different geographical locations using `LAG` and `EXTRACT`

19. Aggregate functions and `CROSS JOIN`
