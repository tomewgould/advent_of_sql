# advent_of_sql
This repository contains my solutions to the Christmas-themed SQL challenges provided by https://adventofsql.com/

I have completed these challenges using PostgreSQL to sharpen my skills and for a bit of fun! 

Solutions contain comments which explain my thinking as well as record what I learned completing each challenge.
